# What's Cookin'

### By Dana Angela Neria

A recipe-managing application for indecisive people; What's Cookin' not only stores your recipes for you,
but also helps you decide what to cook or eat when you just can't decide! 

If you want to eat in,
it can go through your recipes and give you breakfast, lunch, or dinner recommendations depending on the time of day.
It also has the option of giving you a random recipe regardless of what time it is!

If you want take-out, the application can suggest just the general type of cuisine that you should go for,
or it can recommend one of your favourite restaurants.

If you can't even decide between eating in and taking out, 
then you can let What's Cookin' make that decision for you!

This project is of interest to me because I'm a very indecisive person when it comes to food and have
trouble planning my meals. I want to make something that will not only
help me answer the daily question of "What do you want to eat?" but that will also help
me keep track of the recipes I can make.
