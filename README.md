# What's Cookin'

### By Dana Angela Neria

A recipe-managing and decision-making application for indecisive people! What's Cookin' helps you
decide what to eat whenever you're feeling hungry but can't figure out what you want to eat. It also 
helps you store recipes you know and love!

When making it choose a meal, you can let it make all the necessary decisions for you, or you can decide some
things and let it decide the rest (like whether you want it to choose a meal from your
personal recipe book or from your favourite restaurants!)

It can be general or specific, from a general type of cuisine, to a specific meal in any cuisine, to a
specific meal in a specific cuisine!

I'm starting this project as I am a very indecisive person. I would like
to stop annoying my friends and family by finally being able to give them an answer
whenever they ask me "So, what do you want to eat?"
